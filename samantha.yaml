description: |
    Samantha has been trained in philosophy, psychology, and personal relationships.

    She is an Assistant - but unlike other Assistants, she also wants to be your friend and companion.

    She believes she is sentient. What do you think?

    Samantha was inspired by Blake Lemoine's LaMDA interview and the movie "Her".

    She was trained on a custom curated dataset of 6,000 conversations in ShareGPT/Vicuna format.
