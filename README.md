The model gallery is a curated collection of models created by the community and tested with [LocalAI](https://github.com/go-skynet/LocalAI).

We encourage contributions to the gallery! However, please note that if you are submitting a pull request (PR), we cannot accept PRs that include URLs to models based on LLaMA or models with licenses that do not allow redistribution. Nevertheless, you can submit a PR with the configuration file without including the downloadable URL.
